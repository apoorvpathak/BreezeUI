# Breeze UI
## Build Faster with Pre-Made Components.

Breeze UI is a collection of pre-built simple UI components that you can copy and paste into your Projects. I created Breeze UI because as a Backend Engineer, I found it very annoying to build beautiful interfaces for my project to show them to peers. I thought of creating a library of beautiful UI components that I can use whenever I want. 

I thought if I am facing this problem, maybe there are other people too who are not very interested in building Frontend everytime they want to showcase their projects so I decided to make this library of UI components available to everyone in the world, and I did exactly that. 

## Who can use these components ?
Anyone.

## Do I need to attribute Breeze UI?
No, but if it's useful for you, you are welcome to contribute.

## Who owns these UI components ?
Noone.

## Who is liable if my code fails after using these Components ?
You are.
