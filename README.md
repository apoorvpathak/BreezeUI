# Breeze UI

**Build Faster with Pre-Made Components**

Breeze UI is a collection of beautifully designed, pre-built UI components that you can effortlessly copy and paste into your projects. Designed for developers who want to focus on functionality over aesthetics, Breeze UI eliminates the hassle of building interfaces from scratch.

## Why Breeze UI?

As a backend-focused developer, I often found it tedious to create visually appealing interfaces just to showcase my projects. I realized that if I faced this challenge, others might too. That's why I created Breeze UI—a library of ready-to-use components that anyone can use to quickly build stunning interfaces.

Whether you're a backend developer, a hobbyist, or a frontend enthusiast, Breeze UI is here to save you time and effort.
